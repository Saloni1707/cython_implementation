<h2>Cython Backend Messaging App</h2>
<br>
Cython is a powerful tool that sits between Python and C, blending the simplicity of Python with the speed and static typing of C. This project is my hands-on attempt to understand Cython better by building a basic backend application for sending and retrieving messages from a database.

The app uses:

FastAPI for the backend web framework

MongoDB for storing messages

Cython for performance-critical utility functions (like text sanitization)

This is a starter project with core messaging features!
